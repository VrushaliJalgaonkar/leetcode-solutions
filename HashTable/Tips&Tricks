If there are M keys in total, we can achieve the space complexity of O(M) easily when using a hash table.

Most of us might have used an array in each bucket to store values in the same bucket. Ideally, the bucket size is small enough to be regarded as a constant. The time complexity of both insertion and search will be O(1).

But in the worst case, the maximum bucket size will be N. And the time complexity will be O(1) for insertion but O(N) for search.
