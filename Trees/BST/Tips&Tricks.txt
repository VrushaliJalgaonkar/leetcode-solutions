* Inorder traversal of BST is an array sorted in ascending order.
* Successor = "after node", i.e. the next node, or the smallest node after the current one.
       -> To find a successor, go to the right once and then as many times to the left as you could.
                public TreeNode successor(TreeNode root) {
                    root = root.right;
                    while (root.left != null) root = root.left;
                    return root;
                } 
* Predecessor = "before node", i.e. the previous node, or the largest node before the current one.
        -> To find a predecessor, go to the left once and then as many times to the right as you could.
                public TreeNode predecessor(TreeNode root) {
                    root = root.left;
                    while (root.right != null) root = root.right;
                    return root;
                }
